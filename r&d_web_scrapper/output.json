(cird81960 section 2a, 2b).the technological capability baseline against which the advance was measured in this case (cird81960 section 1a) was that although guaranteed delivery of messages and data between it systems was available, due to the security constraints that the company faced it was not possible for the it systems to pass security tokens between the private and public clouds as there was no shared \u201ctrust\u201d mechanism which did not impose a significant performance penalty through having to connect to a 3rd party to provide this mechanism (cird81960 section 1b).the specific technological capability advance sought was to establish how, in practice, to implement a shared security certification and trust mechanism (cird81960 section 1c) which did not rely on the use of a 3rd party, with the associated performance overhead (para 6).\ntechnological uncertainty faced\ntechnological uncertainty facedthe specific technological uncertainty was the practical implementation of such a system without using a 3rd party security validation service. (para 13).\nwork done to resolve the uncertainty\nwork done to resolve the uncertaintyas there was no known or readily deducible approach to resolve the uncertainty, experimentation was necessary to ascertain whether a feasible solution could be developed. the solution needed to satisfy the necessary requirements or characteristics of modern security, including confidentiality, authentication, integrity and non-repudiation.the company\u2019s competent professionals implemented an internally-facing certificate authority server which was able to provide high performance security authentication. this solution was considered not to be readily deducible, given its non-trivial nature for practical implementation. (cird81960 section 2b)the certification server was hosted on the public cloud, rather than the private cloud, and was subsequently licensed to the cloud provider, providing an example of an appreciable improvement to an existing product or service (para 23), as a new technological capability (para 6) for implementing secure hybrid cloud deployments. (cird81960 section 1c)\nboundaries of the r&d project within the commercial/it project\nboundaries of the r&d project within the commercial/it projectthe technological uncertainty was first identified when an implementation of the hybrid architecture using a 3rd party certification system did not provide sufficiently a performant method of authenticating connections between the private and public clouds, and the advance sought was the practical implementation of a solution which did not utilise a 3rd party (para 33).the uncertainty was recognised as resolved when a private certificate \u201cminting\u201d server was implemented on the architecture and was tested to be able to reject expired and invalid certificates.
